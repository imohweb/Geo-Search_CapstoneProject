# Geo-Search_CapstoneProject
In this Capstone Project, I will be creating a geo-search application that will have the following features:
An application web page(s) is/are fully responsive and optimized for a wide variety of form
factors.
User can search for a place of interest.
User can view a map of a place with a map marker identifying the location of the place of
interest.
User can see the local weather conditions (wind speed, temperature, humidity and the
current weather condition).
User can convert the temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit metric system.
User can share a map of a place of interest or its local weather conditions to Facebook.

The project will have optional features such as:
User can view images of notable landmarks in place of interest.
User can view postal codes in place of interest.
Search input field suggests autocompleting options as the user is typing.
Use a customized map marker in your application.
